				<body>
					Hi everyone, in this blog I'll be sharing how we added new event in our orchestrator microservice.
					 <br/>
					 <p>
						Let's understand our business use-case using ShoppersPoint, an e-commerse application.
					 	ShoppersPoint has many microservices that interact with one another using events.
						Kafka is used as message broker to stream the events being produced and consumed within these microservices.
					 </p>
					 <h4>Application Scenario</h4>
					 <p>
						At ShoppersPoint, customers can browse through a range products and services listed on their website, select desired products and add them to cart, book a vendor from list of vendors for services like house-keeping, baby-sitting... and add the booked services to cart, avail offers & discounts on a variety of products and services.
						Customers can check all items in cart, make any modifications if necessary and proceed to checkout.
						During checkout, customer gets a prompt to register/login, in case of a new customer or if any customer has not logged into their ShoppersPoint account.
						Upon registering/ logging into ShoppersPoint account, the customer proceeds to pay for the items in the cart with offers/discounts if applicable.
					 </p>
					 <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
					 <p>
						ShoppersPoint wants to enhance customer experience by increasing responsiveness of the currrent application. ShoppersPoint can be segregated into various microservices like catalog service, user service, cart service, payment service etc.
						Analysing the interactions between these microservices, we found that
						<ul>
							<li>There is a central component called orchestrator which coordinates the activities of other microservices. This component interacts with rest of the microservices using Kafka events.</li>
							<li>There are various steps for every user journey defined within orchestrator that helps control the business operations. The steps can be further segregated into
								<ul>
									<li>User step requiring user action like providing user data, clicking submit button etc.</li>
									<li>System step that can be executed without user intervention, like validating field input, producing acknowledgement when a step completes.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>There are some steps which needs user meta data like user address, phone number, bank details etc. to execute itself. There were times when a considerable delay due to network load etc. while giving required user data back to the services, resulted in a less robust application and reduced it's responsiveness to users.</li>
						</ul>
					 </p>
					 <h4>How can we improve responsiveness and performance of our application?</h4>
					 <p>
						We came up with a strategy to introduce a time-limit so that the steps requiring user meta data waits for certain time interval within which if they get the requested user details, an acknowledgement event is produced.
						Otherwise a failed event is produced for exceeding alloted time-limit and requests orchestrator to retry the failed step.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						We made following changes in
						<ul>
							Microservices requesting for user data
							<li>Created failed event.</li>
							<li>Added time-limit-exceeds error code to existing error codes.</li>
							<li>Registered for time-limit just before requesting user details from user-service.</li>
							<li>Added logic in producers to produce acknowledgement event if user-service returns requested user details within time-limit.</li>
							<li>Added logic in producers to produce failed event if user-service fails to give requested user details within time-limit.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							Orchestrator
							<li>Added logic orchestrator to allow customers to retry if any step fails due to time-limit exceeded error and produce events for success and failed scenarios.</li>
							<li>When orchestrator produces success event, the ui-service acknowledges to customers that their current step has executed successfully.</li>
							<li>When orchestrator produces failed event due to time-limit exceeded error, the ui-service informs the customers that their current step has failed and provides retry option to try again.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							Customer UI (ui-service)
							<li>Added logic in consumer to redirect to retry page when failed event due to time-limit exceeded error is consumed from orchestrator.</li>
						</ul>
					 </p>
					 <h4>Impact on business</h4>
					 <p>
						The performance and responsiveness of ShoppersPoint application improved because of introduction of time limit for steps requiring user details from user-service.
						<br/>
						Improved customer experience as they had minimalistic waiting time and got instant feedback on whether their current step had executed successfully or not.
						In case of failure due to time-limit exceeded, they were able to successfully retry that step and get acknowledgement / success feedback.
					 </p>
					 <h4>Future scope</h4>
					 <p>
						Upon combining our analysis of orchestrator and various customer & business feedback, we found that we could further enhance our application by
						<ul>
							<li>
								Creating a checklist of acknowledged steps in orchestrator to track and debug any failed step.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adding a new functionality in orchestrator to resume any process from the last acknowledged/successful step in the check-list.
							</li>
							<li>
								Create a new microservice called observer-service that consumes of failed events with error codes for various steps requesting data from user-service and in general.
								This can be used to analyse the occurance of various error codes for the steps along with tracking occurance of failed steps and respective error codes.
							</li>
							<li>
								The observer-service can be enhanced further to consume the no of retries for the steps with retry option and respective error codes.
								This can be used to analyse the effectiveness of having retry option for various steps and error codes.
							</li>
						</ul>
